                        <p> Hello! My name is Lauren Heathcote. I grew up in Southern California, and my parents never talked Finances. Neither did my school. Or work. Or any other sphere I was in. I was stressed about adulthoodd and felt there was more I needed to do to prepare myself for what was to come.</p>
                        <p>I started to research. After hours of educating myself, I found resources. I wanted share with my friends what I have learned. But it is hard to express months of work into a short conversation. I wanted to create an infrastructure to give the resources I have to everyone who needs it. </p>
                        <p> That is why I created Things I Didn't Learn in High School, a page to help you know step by step on what you should do to kick start this essential part of your life. Please enjoy and remember that you are wonderful with a bright future ahead of you. Happy planning!</p>
